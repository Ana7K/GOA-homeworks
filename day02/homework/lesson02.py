# Data types are different kinds of information that we give to the computer.
# If we give the computer "Hello", it knows it's text (string).
# If we give it 7, it knows it's a whole number (integer).
# If we give it 7.7, it knows it's a decimal number (float).
# If we give it True or False, it knows it's a yes or no answer (boolean).
