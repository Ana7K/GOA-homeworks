        <h3>where does Lorem Ipsum come from?</h3>
        Contrary to popular belief, <a href = "https://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a> is not simply random text.
        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
        and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

    <b>Isaac Newton</b> is best known for his theory about <strong>the law of gravity</strong>, but his “Principia Mathematica” (1686) with its three laws of motion greatly influenced the Enlightenment in Europe. Born in 1643 in Woolsthorpe, England, Sir Isaac Newton began developing his theories on light, calculus and celestial mechanics while on break from Cambridge University.
Years of research culminated with the 1687 publication of <strong>“Principia,” a landmark work that established the universal laws of motion and gravity.</strong> Newton’s second major book, “Opticks,” detailed his experiments to determine the properties of light. Also a student of Biblical history and alchemy, the famed scientist served as president of the Royal Society of London and master of England’s Royal Mint until his death in 1727.
    <b>Isaac Newton: Early Life and Education</b>
Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. The son of a farmer who died three months before he was born, Newton spent most of his early years with his maternal grandmother after his mother remarried. His education was interrupted by a failed attempt to turn him into a farmer, and he attended the King’s School in Grantham before enrolling at the University of Cambridge’s Trinity College in 1661.
Newton studied a classical curriculum at Cambridge, but he became fascinated by the works of <strong>modern philosophers such as René Descartes</strong>, even devoting a set of notes to his outside readings he titled <b>“Quaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae”</b> (“Certain Philosophical Questions”). <strong>When the Great Plague shuttered Cambridge in 1665</strong>, Newton returned home and began formulating his theories on calculus, light and color, his farm the setting for the supposed falling apple that inspired his work on gravity.
